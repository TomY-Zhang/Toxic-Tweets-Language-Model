Hangul should then be second. Hanja 3rd. Japanese has no place in this case because 1. In Japanese versions of the game, the name is represented in romanization, and in story modes also in English! Katakana doesn't belong because it's an ENGLISH article and provides no value whatsoever to English readers. Romanization of Katakana has even LESS place, as it is romanizing something that has altered the original sound to begin with. Since we are romanizing from the source (English title), showing the source(Hangul), and showing the meaning (hanja), why is there need to show how Japanese would best estimate how to pronounce the source in their own language?

 == Silly criticism == 

 Software installed by users must be written in Java. This provides end-users with less control over their phone's functionality. - I'm not sure if this is just very written very badly or if it is plain wrong. From the perspective of an end user, there is absolutely no concern of what language has been used to write some software. As far as I know, andoid will be the first mobile phone OS ever to allow users to replace any application, even the phone number dialer. So there is no point in stating that end-users have less control. 

 Even if you take it from the perspective of a developer, it's wrong. From most known systems before android it was a common truth that Java-programs have very limited access to the features of a device, and that you needed some form of native machine code to access all of the funtionality. Google states that they have create Java APIs that allow the developer access to all of the phones functionality, and that they themselves only use those APIs. I can see no real reason to disbelieve those statements. 

 Also, the criticism suggests that there is less control. Less than what / less then where? For most phones, you can not write native software at all, and even if you can (line iPhone and SymbianOS) this doesn't grant you access to all possible features.    
 :It's poorly worded, but there is some truth to it.  Not """"All"""" functionality can be reproduced in the exposed Java APIs.   Less control is available to java apps then is available to native apps running on Android.  Those who have root access to Android phone, perhaps because the purchased the Android dev phone, are able to write native applications and deploy them to their phone that can do things that java apps using the supported platform can't.    Contributors will continue to improve the java API's though, and Android's java platform provides for good sandboxing and permission control.     

 In my opinion, the entire criticism section needs to be looked at.  Often times a """"criticism"""" section on a Wikipedia page is added by someone who dislikes the product and presents every little problem with it as a significant criticism.  If nothing else, the section should be renamed """"Restrictions"""", as that is the header the exact same issues are listed under on the iPhone article.  I'm going to at least be bold and do that.   

 I agree that criticisms are often presented from a bias point of view without notability, but that must be addressed by removing controversial material without citation. I'm going to change the s",obscene,8.39476e-05,obscene,8.39476e-05

 I don't plan on personally editing this article anymore since a few have taken issue with it, and I will not personally remove the proposed deletion tag but I would like to note a few reasons why I think the call for deletion is premature.

 I would also consider the Bleeding Cool interview national/international coverage as bleedingcool.com gets tens of thousands of hits daily from all over the world, is often referenced by other publications, such as The New York Observer recently and has many notable contributors, American and British. 
 I Taste Sound's distributor also sends books to Canada and England on occasion and for what it's worth, I don't have personal communications with any individuals in West Virginia or Chicago, since I noticed speculation on one of these threads that I contacted a friend or fan there to have them make edits to the article.",obscene,4.7452035e-05,obscene,4.7452035e-05

 == Lack of a Section Regarding the Royal Rooters == 

 I have to ask why there is no section regarding the Royal Rooters, the fan organization that formed in the late 19th century. The history of this organization ties in closely with early Red Sox Nation, and with baseball's history in general. I suggest that that article be merged with this one, or that this article have at least a small section regarding both the Rooters from the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as the modern Royal Rooters of Red Sox Nation.  

 :Why? There's an article for both of them (see Royal Rooters, Red Sox Nation), there's no need to paste that information here    

 == Proposed Merge == 

  

 Since I don't see any discussion on the proposed merge (of merging Red Sox Nation into Boston Red Sox) by X3210, I will start it off. 
 *Strongly Oppose - Red Sox Nation should not be merged. The term for the group of fans is notable (it is mentioned in all types of media, ranging from national (ESPN) to local). There is no reason as to why they should be merged. Red Sox Nation is a term used to describe the fans, whereas the Boston Red Sox article is about the team. -  
 *Oppose - per Zomic13 and frankly I ready don't think the merger template should had even been added before a discussion had even begun with the reasons.▪◦▪  
 *Oppose per both above. I removed the template; if and when someone takes the time to make a case for merging, they should feel free to add the merge template back in. -  
 *Oppose. No reasons given for merge. While I'm sure I could come up with a few, the onus is on the nominee to actually come up with something before meaningful discussion can begin.   •   
 *Merge. The fans, and type of fans, are arguably the most important part of the team. No fans = no team. For a similar discussion see Talk:New York Yankees#Merge Yankees Universe.   
 *Do not merge.  Both articles are well written, sourced, and the Red Sox article is already way too lengthy.  Leave them both alone.   |   
 *and on another note..., I would like to see the sections titled """"2004 Season"""" and """"2007 season"""" drastically reduced to avoid the perception of recentivism.  They both have """"main article"""" redirects, but then go on to tell the WHOLE STORY without pause.  Silly repetition of information, and a waste of server space.    The sox won 5 world series prior to 2004 and the attention given to them in contrast to the latest two championships proves my accusation of recentivism.  I'm not saying that the 04/07 teams aren't important.  They are, whether I like it or not.  However, in an article about a baseball team that is over 100 years old, these two seasons only account for about 2% of their existence. They deserve mention, some BASICS, then a redirect.   |

 So he is a fake ass studio gangsta. Why he raps about doing crimes if he didn""""t do anything. He is fake. 

 No he got bailed out of jail by Eazy-E to produce for ruthless records or something like that. He has commited crimes in his life. I'll try to get a source if necessary but Dre does have street credibility  

 Why Eazy E and 2pac said that Dr Dre is gay? And Eazy said that Dr Dre have not comited any crimes. So please get a source that says that Dr Dre has comited crimes. LOL

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQC6cnkFBBY 

 Dr Dre is a studio gangsta and he is not a blood!!!!! 

 No one ever said Dre was a blood I don't know where you are getting that from. He was never in a gang and never claimed to be. He has been arrested and been to court however. Why are you citing an Eazy E verse, are you a complete idiot? Since when do rapper's lyrics subsitute for fact, especially in a diss song. Eazy E isn't any more of a """"gangsta"""" than Dre is. All he ever did was sell a few ounces. In fact no one from N.W.A. was in the crips or bloods. And Eazy-E and 2pac calling him gay means nothing. That's what rappers do when they've got beef. 2Pac was never in a gang either, unless you count hanging out with Suge. Btw did you know 2pac did ballet as a kid? Bottom line is, Dre is a dope producer. 

 I agree with the guy above, if you are stupid enough to take lyrics from diss songs seriously then you are sad. Tupac was only pissed at Dr. Dre because he left Death Row, because Dre was smart and knew something bad was about to happen sooner or later, and something bad did happen. 'Pac died, Suge got jailed, Snoop left, Kurupt left, everyone else left, after that they started to release albums that didn't even go Gold, so I guess it was a great move by Dre. However, Death Row was like a family and when you left that family everyone would turn against you, that is why Suge, 'Pac, and all these other guys like Tha Realest or J-Flexx (these 2 joined Death Row after 1996) started to release songs to diss Dre, and not only him, they were pissed at Snoop too, Tupac stopped talking to Snoop Dogg after he said he respects the people from Bad Boy, so it wasn't just against Dre. Also, Dr. Dre was never a Crip or a Blood, I don't know why people think he was in a gang, but for whatever reason you people think so, it is wrong, so stop claiming he is. Then after everyone left Death Row Suge started to hate on everyone, and that's what he's still doing, hating, because he knows he won't release another album that will sell over 100 copies ever again. Another thing, Dr. Dre is not gay, Jesus, he has a wife, he has like 13 kids, don't believe everything that Eazy says,",obscene,0.9971342,obscene,0.9971342

 """"A very popular president runs as the vice president during an election, but everyone knows they are really voting for him. After the election, the president resigns."""" This popular vice president who becomes president again would have the support of the people, in order to win votes, and maybe also the support of US Congress, but it would reasonably count as being reelected again. In fact, there are situations like the current president of Turkey that are very similar to this. (In his case, he couldn't become prime minister again.)

 I never made any judgements about the quality of the other productions. The greatest concern you have brought up is a clear lack of professionalism, tact, and objectivity.
