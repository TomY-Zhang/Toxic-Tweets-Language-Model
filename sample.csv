 : But did he author the report? He is not identified in the Western media as an author or originator of the report. Additionally, if he is not a high profile expert on terrorism, I think the single mention at the Srebrenica Massacre entry is sufficient.  Name one influential book or paper DT has authored?  If not I believe there is a total lack of objectivity at work here.  DT has pointed out that this campaign coincides with vicious attack blogs by the pseudonym Johnstone and others.  At worst he is a compiler, a government employee of the BiH government, certainly not a war criminal.  Also while Srebrenica massacre may be a well known event, DT played no role at all in it, and the hyperbole """"single most notable massacre in modern European history"""" is way off base, I think Srbrenica can be compared to Croat ethnic cleansing in Krajina and Croat atrocities against Muslims in Mostar, in fact it is similar to murder of Greeks in Cyprus and falls way short of deaths of civilians in Chechnya. Soi why so eager to hang the Srebrenica Massacre on someone who wasn't there and is not a world renowned expert on terrorism.  Do I sense a personal agenda by ChrisO and others.

 == Good article processes == 

 As you're already aware, """"GA"""" on Wikipedia typically refers to a """"Good article"""". To obtain this quality rating, an article must be nominated at WP:Good article nominations, or GAN, where it is reviewed by an uninvolved editor. Given the backlog on the page, nominations can sometimes sit for a while until a reviewer comes along. The reviewer compares the article to the Good article criteria and will either pass or fail the nomination. Should an article degrade over time or the passed nomination is contentious, editors can place the article up for reassessment at WP:Good article reassessment, or GAR. Depending on the reassessment discussion, the article will either retain or lose its GA status. To further add more to digest, there are also Good topics, which are collections of Good articles that are within the same scope. 

 You'll see these terms pretty regularly at the VG project because many editors there try to bring articles up to Good quality, partly as a badge of honor, but also because review by an outside party ensures that quality is actually there. Hope that explains everything. If you have anymore questions, please let me know. (  )""",obscene,5.7314417e-05,obscene,5.7314417e-05
